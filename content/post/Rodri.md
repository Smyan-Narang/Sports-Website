## How Do Manchester City Cope Without Rodri?

Manchester City have thrived in recent seasons with the reliable presence of Rodri in midfield, a player whose skillset uniquely combines defensive solidity, ball progression, and composure under pressure. However, when Rodri is absent, City’s performance often suffers, revealing how deeply the team depends on his ability to dictate play and break down opposition transitions. With Rodri out for the season, City faces the need to develop a more resilient approach to cope without their midfield anchor.

### Rodri’s Unique Skillset and City’s Dependence on Him

Rodri’s impact is difficult to replicate. He has a rare ability to anticipate the game defensively while simultaneously orchestrating offensive moves with his accurate passing and ball control. He balances the team’s structure, providing a defensive shield while seamlessly transitioning City’s play from back to front. His ability to intercept, read the game, and efficiently pass forward has been a stabilizing force, particularly in high-pressure situations. Without him, City’s shape often becomes more vulnerable to counterattacks, as seen in games where they’ve struggled to manage transitions.

### Manchester City’s 3-1-3-3 System and Kovacic as the Lone 6

This season, City has employed a flexible 3-1-3-3 formation that relies heavily on a strong presence in the midfield pivot. With Rodri’s absence, Mateo Kovacic has been tasked with playing as the lone No. 6. While Kovacic has performed admirably, his skillset differs from Rodri’s. He’s an adept ball carrier and progressive passer but lacks the same level of defensive robustness, often being exposed when defending transitions. Additionally, without a natural backup for this role, Kovacic has been burdened with the entire defensive responsibility, which has occasionally left City susceptible to quick opposition attacks.

### Why City Should Look for a 6/8 Hybrid

Rather than a strict like-for-like replacement, City’s ideal reinforcement would be a 6/8 hybrid—a player who can serve as the lone defensive midfielder when needed but also partner with Rodri in a dual-pivot system. This hybrid profile would offer versatility, allowing City to adapt more fluidly and providing depth that supports Rodri’s playmaking without burdening him with full defensive duties. Such a player could compete with Kovacic during Rodri’s absence while forming a formidable midfield partnership upon his return.

### Exequiel Palacios: The Perfect Candidate for City’s Midfield

One standout option for City is Exequiel Palacios, who has enjoyed a breakout season at Bayer Leverkusen. Integral to Leverkusen’s success, Palacios combines ball-winning tenacity with playmaking skill, marking him as an ideal hybrid for City. This season, Palacios has excelled both as a defensive anchor and as a deep-lying playmaker. He contributes to possession by leading in assists, expected assists, progressive passes, key passes, and entries into the final third and penalty area. His dribbling and press resistance make him invaluable against high-press teams, while his expansive passing range aligns with City’s possession-based approach.

Primarily playing alongside Granit Xhaka at Leverkusen, Palacios has also proven that he can take on creative responsibilities, adding another layer to his dynamic skillset. Where City struggled last season—defending transitions—Palacios shines. His defensive work rate ranks him highly in tackles, interceptions, duels won, and ball recoveries, marking him as a midfield “destroyer” who could ease Rodri’s defensive burden. Palacios has a great ability to cover ground, quickly close down attackers, and recover the ball, a quality Kovacic has lacked when playing as the lone 6

Palacios’ versatility would allow him to cover for Rodri when needed, while simultaneously giving Kovacic meaningful competition. Additionally, under Pep Guardiola, he could develop further as a creative No. 8, similar to how Declan Rice evolved into a complete box-to-box midfielder under Mikel Arteta at Arsenal. Palacios’ positioning, skill in tight spaces, and vision in the final third would make him an ideal candidate to work alongside or even replace Rodri, as City navigates the challenges of a long and demanding season.

In the long run, a player like Palacios would not only strengthen City’s midfield depth but also provide tactical options that increase their resilience and flexibility, ensuring they can better cope when Rodri is unavailable.
