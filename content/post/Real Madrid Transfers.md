Real Madrid were the best club in the 23/24 season, winning the Champions League unbeaten as well as the La liga. It is extremely tough to improve a team that just won the biggest trophy in club football, but there was one area where Madrid felt especially weak, in terms of depth, which was the center back. With Nacho's departure and Alaba's ACL tear, Madrid only have 2 proper Center Backs until at least January. While Tchouameni can play as a CB, it definitely isn't sustainable long term. The age of both Alaba and Rudiger is also a potential cause for concern, and Madrid would want to invest in a long term replacement who can play as a squad player for a couple of seasons, and then takes over the role of the starting CB for Madrid. Another notable departure is that of Toni Kroos, having retired from Professional Football. He created the most chances for Madrid, while also dictating the tempo of the game. Without him, the only real playmaker they have is Modric, who is already past his prime and is likely to retire at the end of the 24/25 season. So madrid need a midfielder who can both control the game and create chances

## Transfers to replace Toni Kroos

1.**Vitinha**

Vitinha is probably one of the most improved players in Europe this season. He has been one of the best Midfielders in all of Europe this season, and was deservedly in the Champions league team of the season. He has positional versatility while also having a lot of experience playing in a team with a similar controlled possession style of play to Madrid, while also having an excellent eye for a long pass, similiar to Kroos, which means it would be easier for him to adapt to the system. He has 7 goals and 4 assists in 28 Ligue 1 games, with 2 goals and an assist in 12 champions league games. Not only that, but he stands out Shot creating actions, Goal creating actions, Progressive passes, successful take ons, passes attempted and completed, passes into the final third, passes into the penalty area, key passes, Carries, progressive carrying distance, ball recoveries. All these stats showcase him to be one of the best press resistant deeper lying midfielders in Europe right now. He has started most games as a box to box midfielder or as a holding midfielder for PSG, often playing side by side with Ugarte as a CDM or controlling the game all by himself. This makes him a perfect tactical fit for Madrid,  as his ability to sit deep and dictate games while adding press resistance to the midfield makes him an extremely valuable asset. He also stood out in terms of Ball recovories, which also highlights that he can hold his own defensively, when needed. He is valued at just 55m, and when Madrid comes calling, its nearly impossible to say no. 

2.**Exequiel Palacios**

Exequiel Palacios has had a breakout season at Bayer Leverkusen. He has been a key part of their success in the 23/24 season, standing out as an excellent ball winner and a deep lying playmaker. In possession, Palacios stands out in terms of his assists, expected assists, Progressive Passes, Key passes, Passes into the final third, Passes into the Penalty area, Progressive carries, carries, successful take ons and successful take on %. He is extremely press resistant and has an expansive passing range. This season he has primarily played as a ball winner next to Granit Xhaka, who has been the main deep lying playmaker in the team, but Palacios has proven to be more than good enough to replace his creative ability at Leverkusen. What also stands out is his ability off the ball. He is incredible at defending transitions, and he stands out in tackles, interceptions, duels won, dribblers tackled, and ball recoveries. He is very press resistant and has an excellent ability to wiggle out of tight situations, and also has an element of 'Pausa' in his game, with an ability to dictate the tempo of the game. He is just 25, valued at 40m, and can develop into a truly world class CM/CDM Hybrid at Madrid, truly honing into his playmaking abilities.  

## Transfers for CB


1.**Goncalo Inacio**

Goncalo Inacio plays as a left sided center back in a back 3, and has really blossomed into that role under Ruben Amorim. He stands out when it comes to Progressive passes, progressive carries, succesful take-ons, expected assists, passes into the final third, passes into the penalty area, shot creating actions and goal creating actions. All these paint a picture of a center back who's very good on the ball and can create chances for the team from deeper areas. Another stat that stands out to me is his high number of progressive passes received, which highlights that he often receives the ball further up the pitch, in midfield areas. While Madrid don't typically push their defenders into midfield, it does offer an extra option.  On the defensive side of things, he stands out as well, especially in areas such as tackles, dribblers challenged, and recoveries, all while playing in a posession based team. He is valued at 45m, and would be a perfect fit for the long term plans of this Madrid team. 

2.**Ousmane Diomande**

Ousmane Diomande is a center back who's quite similiar to a player who Madrid already pursued, Leny Yoro. Diomande's style of defending is very akin to that of a Varane or a Van Dijk, in that he's quite calm and composed, but can hold his own in any 1v1 situation, as well as being an absolute monster in the air. He stands out when it comes to Percentage of dribblers tackled, Duels won, Dribbled past, aeriels won and percentage of aerials won. He's very quick, and can keep up pace with just about any attacker. He offers a very different style of defending to Inacio, who tends to be more aggressive and tries to win the ball back a bit higher up the pitch. On the ball, while Diomande isn't someone who can create chances from Center back, he is very safe and nimble on the ball, having an ability to wriggle out of the tightest situations and carry the ball forward. He participates a lot in the build up, and Madrid is not a team which currently relies on their center backs to create a lot of chances, so Diomande can definitely fit in quite well at Madrid.
