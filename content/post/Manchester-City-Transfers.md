## Transfers for the CDM/CM Hybrid Role

1. **Bruno Guimarães:**

Bruno Guimarães is already one of the best midfielders in the premier league currently. Not only does he have 7 goals and 8 assists but he also stands out in several key areas against midfielders across the world. These include but are not limited to shot creating actions, progressive passes, successful take ons, through balls, goal creating actions, and passes into the penalty area. Alongside that, we can also highlight his defensive stats. At first glance, his defensive stats may look average at best, however he plays in a team that keeps a good amount of the ball, so the amount of defensive actions he needs to commit are lower. There are still several defensive actions that stand out, including ball recoveries and shot creating actions from a defensive action. These make him one of the best pressing midfielders in the Premier League, and his ability to create chances by forcing high turnovers is a huge asset. His technical ability on the ball stands out the most, with an incredible return in total carries, carries into the final third, carries into the penalty box, and carrying distance, while leading the league in successful take ons. This technical ability allows him to complement a player like Rodri perfectly as he is the perfect press-resistant Pep midfielder. One of the key aspects Pep needs from his midfielders is versatility. I believe that Bruno Guimarães is the most versatile midfielder in the premier league right now, with an ability to play as an out and out 8 (box-to-box midfielder) or a 6/8 hybrid, similar to how Kovacic plays currently in City’s system, or a complete press-resistant 6 who can be the pivot in a ball-playing team. His tactical versatility will also take some load off Rodri, which is extremely necessary as he was playing too many games last season. His ability to make late runs into the box, especially towards the edge of the box while finding space, allows him to replicate the qualities of a player massively missed by City last season, Ilkay Gundogan. Gundogan’s box-crashing abilities combined with his technical and defensive abilities made him a perfect box-to-box midfielder, and Bruno Guimarães is the perfect long-term replacement for Gundogan, with potentially an even higher ceiling. His incredible physicality is also a huge asset to have in a Premier League team, and his ability to use his physicality to shield the ball while carrying but also to win duels is a huge positive as well. He has a £100m release clause in his contract, but his versatility and his ability to be a world-class player in 3 different positions make him an extremely valuable asset to any team, and Manchester City are frontrunners to sign him this season.

2. **Vitinha**

Vitinha is probably one of the most improved players in Europe this season. He has been one of the best midfielders in all of Europe this season, and was deservedly in the Champions League team of the season. He has positional versatility while also having a lot of experience playing in a team with a similar controlled possession style of play to Manchester City, which means it would be easier for him to adapt to Pep’s system. He has 7 goals and 4 assists in 28 Ligue 1 games, with 2 goals and an assist in 12 Champions League games. Not only that, but he stands out in shot-creating actions, goal-creating actions, progressive passes, successful take-ons, passes attempted and completed, passes into the final third, passes into the penalty area, key passes, carries, progressive carrying distance, and ball recoveries. All these stats showcase him to be one of the best press-resistant deeper-lying midfielders in Europe right now. He has started most games as a box-to-box midfielder or as a holding midfielder for PSG, often playing side by side with Ugarte as a CDM or controlling the game all by himself. This makes him a perfect tactical fit for Manchester City, as his ability to sit deep and dictate games with Rodri while adding press resistance to the midfield makes him an extremely valuable asset. Another key fact is that while Bruno Guimarães outperforms his xG/90 by about 0.05 goals/90, Vitinha outperforms it by 0.13 goals/90, ranking him as one of the best finishers in Europe. His incredible long-range shooting ability adds an element of surprise to the City team, and due to his familiarity with the system, he should be quicker to adapt to Pep’s system. However, one key drawback is that he is only 5’7”, and thus it would be risky playing him as a single CDM in Rodri’s absence. He does require a ball-winning CDM with him for him to function at his best. He is currently valued at just £50m and at market price would be an absolute steal of a deal.

3. **Joey Veerman**

Joey Veerman is one of the best midfielders in the Eredivisie and was one of the most important players in PSV. He was the highest-rated midfielder in the Eredivisie, and for good reason. He finished the season with 5 goals and 16 assists in 29 matches. He functions as a deep-lying playmaker in a double pivot in PSV’s 4-2-3-1 and would slot in perfectly next to Rodri in a double pivot and can take a lot of the creative load in the team when Kevin De Bruyne is not playing. He is in the 99th percentile of all midfielders in several key statistics, including assists, progressive passes, key passes, passes into the final third, passes into the penalty area, shot-creating actions, and goal-creating actions, while also being in the top 10 percentile for non-penalty goals. He has outperformed his xG throughout the season, making him a competent finisher. However, most of his goals have come from long-range goals, and he isn’t particularly proficient in making late runs into the box the way Bruno Guimarães and Vitinha are, and that is reflected in the average shooting distance for all these players. He does have an ability to provide something different as a deep-lying playmaker. He is also a solid player defensively, being in the top 10 percentile for dribblers tackled and dribblers challenged, while also being among the best midfielders in ball recoveries, tackles won, and goal-creating actions from defensive actions. Achieving all of these stats while playing in a possession-based team shows a player who is solid defensively and offensively. His market value currently is only £40m, and surprisingly he hasn’t been linked to a lot of clubs. His signing would also allow them to spend money on signing a backup CDM such as Weiffer to cover for Rodri. He isn’t the same profile as Guimarães or Vitinha, but he is an excellent midfielder and can offer a lot of creativity from deeper areas and bring a level of dynamism to City’s midfield.

4. **Youssouf Fofana**

Youssouf Fofana is an excellent press-resistant midfielder playing for Monaco. He stands out in several key areas, including progressive passes, passes into the penalty area, passes into the final third, successful take-ons, carries into the final third, and ball recoveries. One of the key qualities of Youssouf Fofana is his ability to carry the ball forward and escape tight situations using his technical prowess, and his ability to progress the ball from defense to midfield to attack and create chances. He can play as a 6 or as an 8, and can provide cover for Rodri while also being a good option as a 6/8 hybrid in City’s 2-3-5 system. His market value is only £30m, but is expected to rise over the course of the summer as several clubs are linked to him.

## Transfers for the Right Back role to replace Kyle Walker Long term

1. **Mohamed Simakan**

Mohamed Simakan plays as a right back or a right center back for RB Leipzig. He has played most of this season as a CB, but his numbers as a right back are excellent. What City needs is a right back who can play both as a right back and as a right center back in a back 3 or even a right-sided center back in a back 4. He has also played as a wing back in a back 5 for RB Leipzig. His incredible versatility combined with his incredible technical ability make him a perfect defender for City. He stands out in goals, assists, shot-creating actions, progressive carries, successful take-ons, key passes, crosses into the penalty area, through balls, shot-creating actions, goal-creating actions, tackles, dribblers tackled, passes blocked, and carries into the penalty area. His incredible ability to get out of tight spaces by using his technical ability and his explosive pace allows him to carry the ball large distances and create chances. He can even push into midfield and join City in their 2-3-5 shape, and can play as a wingback in possession. Defensively, he is more than sound enough to defend against most top wingers, and his arrival will massively improve City’s attacking threat from the right side and will also improve their rest defense and protect them against counter-attacks. He is quite expensive as his release clause is worth £70m, but he is still very young and is an investment for the future, and can develop as a long-term replacement for John Stones by replicating his progressive carrying ability and his technical ability on the ball.

2. **Lutsharel Geertruida**

Geertruida plays as a right back for Feyenoord, and has been used as an inverting right back the entire season. His technical ability and defensive ability stand out. His ability to join the midfield in a 2-3-5 while also having the ability to sit back in a back 3 makes him a huge asset in any team he plays. However, his crossing ability is limited and he can’t function particularly well as a wingback. He stands out in goals, assists, progressive passes, shot-creating actions, passes into the final third, carries, progressive carrying distance, percentage of dribblers tackled, and aerials won. This shows that he is an excellent all-around right back who can be a great long-term replacement for Kyle Walker. He massively improves Manchester City’s rest defense, and his ability to create chances from deeper areas while inverting gives him an X-factor that City could definitely use against teams sitting in a low block. He is valued at £35 million but he does have a release clause worth £40m, and would be an excellent signing for this City defense.
