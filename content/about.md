Hey. I'm Smyan Narang, a tech enthusiast and sports enthusiast who plans to pursue Computer Science in University. 

My interest in technology and Computer Science grew a lot during the pandemic, and I've always been a football and cricket 

enthusiast from a young age. I'm currently in 12th Grade at Scottish High International School and I'm graduating in 2025. 

I currently serve as the Deputy Head Boy of Scottish High International School and I am also the president of the Computer Science 

club as well as the advisor to our annual tech event SHISTECH.
